 * `make verify` followed by `make test` used to go red on rows this script itself had written. The
 * cleanup at the end of the run is what closes that, and it needs a connection the browser cannot
 * give it.
 *
 * A query answers with the first column of its first row and a write with the number of rows it
 * touched. Those are two different questions and the first version of this printed `rowcount` for
 * both: `SELECT count(*)` returns exactly one row whatever the catalogue holds, so the "is it zero"
 * check below read `1` against a database that was already clean and could never have passed.
 *
 * The URL comes from the application's own settings, so a walkthrough pointed at a different database
 * cleans up that one. A failure is reported and returned, never thrown: cleanup runs last, and a
